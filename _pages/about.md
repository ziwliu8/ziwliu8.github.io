<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Currently, I am a Ph.D student in the *AML Lab* at the School of ***Data Science***, ***City University of Hong Kong***. Before this, I earned my Master's degree at CityU under the supervision of ***Prof. Zhao Xiangyu***. I also obtained my Bachelor's degree in Robotics Engineering from Southeast University, where ***Prof. Gan Yahui*** and ***Prof. Li Jun*** co-supervised me. 

My research interest includes Recommender Systems, Information Retrieval & LLM. I have published several papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_H3nmDQAAAAJ'> Google Scholar citations.
